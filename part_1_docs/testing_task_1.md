### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
   
  #  need '==' when comparing. 
  #  else needs a ':'

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2): 
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  
  # Spelling error on def. This wont initialise the function. 
  # card is not defined so won't return anything. typo meant card1
  # missing comma separating card1 and card2

def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total

#  total needs to be set to zero for total to be initialised and the count to be successful.
#  needs to be in the class statement or else the function won't recognise self. 
# return out of the for loop. 
  
```
